# intro
Repository containing a few simple css files with helper classes.
Realy trying to keep it basic css and uncomplicated.

Target audience is 1 person, a dear friend who is not a css person but has content to share with the world.
You can find this nice content on https://www.yncke.be/

# example
Open the html file in the example folder.
That code contains a simple page with a few cards in a asymetric grid.

The inline style is not in the css classes but was needed to make the page look good. Idealy the inline styles should also become a css helper file.
